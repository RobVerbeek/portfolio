                    <p>
                        LanguageTeams, a language school offering group lessons, faced a growing challenge: their manual scheduling process using Excel had become inefficient and error-prone. 
                        They needed a solution that could automate lesson planning while respecting complex business rules. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To improve the quality of life for the teachers and administrators we needed to replace the manual Excel-based scheduling process with a smart, automated system
                        and also provide an application that was easy to use. 
                    </p>

                        <span class="fw-bold">My responsibility</span> was to develop an automated scheduling engine capable of generating weekly lesson plans that accounted for complex real-world constraints like teacher availability, 
                        room assignments, group sizes, and course requirements.

                    <h1 class="">The Plan</h1>
                    <p>
                        Because of the size and complexity of this project, 
                        I created a project plan to ensure that all the steps that were needed to be taken were clear and that the project had estimated deadlines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since my internship was only 13 weeks, I divided the project into 3 phases:
                        <ul style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
                            <li>Research Phase, research and find solutions for the problem - <span class="fw-bold">3 weeks</span></li>
                            <li>Testing Phase, test the found solutions - <span class="fw-bold">7 weeks</span></li>
                            <li>Implementation Phase, implement the solution created during testing with the application - <span class="fw-bold">3 weeks</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For more information about the research and the different phases of the project, you can read the project plan documentation.

                        <h2>The solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            The solution I developed consists of two main components:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Genetic Algorithm Planner</strong>: A reliable, efficient, and deterministic scheduling engine that uses genetic algorithms to generate optimal lesson plans based on the defined constraints.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Agentic AI Planner</strong>: An experimental planner that leverages large language models (LLMs) to reason about scheduling decisions, providing a more flexible and adaptive approach.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The idea to create two planners was to provide a reliable solution that could be used in production, while also experimenting with the latest AI technologies to explore their potential in scheduling tasks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because genetic algorithms are a well-known and reliable solution for scheduling problems, I decided to implement this first and see how far I could take the Agentic AI Planner afterwards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Genetic Algorithm Planner was implemented using the <span class="fw-bold">DEAP</span> library, which provides a framework for evolutionary algorithms in Python. 
                            The Agentic AI Planner was built using <span class="fw-bold">LangChain</span> and <span class="fw-bold">LangGraph</span>, allowing for complex reasoning and decision-making based on natural language inputs.
                        </p>
                        <div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center justify-content-md-evenly pt-4">

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The planners were integrated into a Django application, which served as the backend for the LanguageTeams scheduling system. 
                            The application was deployed on Azure App Services, with a PostgreSQL database for storing scheduling data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a detailed overview of the implementation you can read the documentation of the project.

                        <p>
                            The project successfully delivered a robust scheduling solution that significantly improved the efficiency of LanguageTeams' lesson planning process. 
                            The Genetic Algorithm Planner provided a reliable and deterministic approach to scheduling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This planner was also succesfully integrated into the Django application, automatically generating a planning on a weekly basis,
                            which was then displayed in the application for administrators to review and adjust as needed. 
                            And ultimately, after being approved, the planning was sent to the teachers who could then view their schedule in the application.

                            The Agentic AI Planner, while still experimental, demonstrated the potential of using large language models for reasoning about complex scheduling tasks. 
                            This opens up new possibilities for future enhancements and adaptations of the scheduling system. 
                            However, the Agentic AI Planner still has issues with the reasoning and decision-making process, which needs to be improved in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These issues are more of a fundemental problem with the use of LLMs for reasoning about complex tasks, 
                            namely that they are prone to hallucinations and can struggle with maintaining consistency in their reasoning.
                            This is a major challenge when using LLMs for tasks that require a high degree of accuracy and reliability, such as scheduling.

                        <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            During my internship at B-Robots, I developed an automated scheduling system for LanguageTeams, replacing their manual Excel-based process with a smart, constraint-driven solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project helped me grow both technically and professionally. I learned how to apply genetic algorithms to complex planning problems and explored the potential of large language models for reasoning about real-world tasks. I also gained valuable insights into software planning, documentation, and interdisciplinary teamwork.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A key takeaway was the importance of choosing the right solution for the problem which is not necessarily the most advanced one. Developers should always aim to solve the problem in the most effective and sustainable way possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm proud of the result and thankful for the opportunity. I look forward to seeing how LanguageTeams continues to benefit from this solution.
                        </p>
