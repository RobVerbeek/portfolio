                    EDA (Explorative Data Analysis)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first step I took towards this project is exploring the data, it's crucial to understand the data in order to create
                    a good prediction model. During the exploration of the data I can find outliers, any biases that might be in the data and
                    find missing data which could cause problems during the training of the model.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span>Filtering Outliers:</span> Finding outliers and removing them can improve the accuracy of the model since it will be easier
                        to generalize decisions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Data Scaling:</span> Since the biomarkers have different ranges, the model might assign different weights to the features depending
                        on their range, to combat this and make all features equal I used a standardscaler. This will change all the biomarkers to be within a range of
                        0 to 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Visualization:</span> This helps to find obvious outliers and gives a clear oversight of all the data, to help with this I used
                        SweetViz and MatPlotLib for Python.

                <h2>
                    Creating the model
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Random Forest is a popular learning method used in machine learning for classification and regression. Because this project
                    is a classification problem, I chose to use random forest. Simply put the Random forest is a collection of decision trees that the algorithm
                    creates, these decision trees all consist out of different decisions and the forest will find the best one from all these trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to train the model I need a data set for training the model and another for validating the model. These datasets can be
                    created from a single training data set, that means that I have a dataset with the features or biomarkers in this context and the answers. This set is then split usually
                    80/20 in order to have a validation set of which you know the answers and can calculate the models accuracy against.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to get a better result on the model I used hyperparameter tuning, tried various combinations of features and cross-validated the
                    results of the Random Forest model.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span>Hyperparameter tuning:</span> Consists of various constrictions for the model, such as the depth of the tree,
                    amount of trees in the forest and the strictness for the model to make decisions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Features:</span> Just because you are given a dozen or dozens of biomarkers doesn't mean that all of them are
                    important for the model to make its decisions, calculating the feature importance and messing around with combinations of them
                    can result in a better outcome.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Cross Validation:</span> Cross validation makes use of different splits in the dataset for training and validation,
                        this will improve the reliability of the model and reduce the variance, this lets your model generalize better instead of focussing
                        on finding the answers for the provided dataset.
                    </li>

                    <h2>Strengthening The Model</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order to increase accuracy even more and combat overfitting and bias, I combined my Random Forest model with a
                        voting classifier. The voting classifier will find the best decisions of the different forests that I made,
                        it will then combine these decisions into a new model with the goal of improving the accuracy further.
                    </p>
                </section>
            <section>
                <h2>
                    Results
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To check the accuracy of my model I used a confusion matrix, this will display how many predictions it made correctly on the
                    validation set, besides that it will also show false positives and false negatives. For heart disease it would be better to have
                    false positives than negatives since a positive can always be further tested but a false negative could be fatal.
