                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The project started off during project week, this week was dedicated entirely to working out a concept
                            for the website, starting off from the documentation that was given to us.
                            This contained use-case diagrams, use-case descriptions and low level prototypes.
                            To make the best use of this information we first had a meeting with the client, where we
                            asked questions to ensure we were on the same page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using the documentation and information from the meeting our team got to work at designing the website,
                            reworking the use-case diagram, adding or removing use-cases as we deemed necessary and creating higher level prototypes.
                            I was in charge of creating a new use-case-diagram. I kept the functionalities on which we agreed should be kept and
                            added the new functionalities we thought should be added.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between">
                        <div class="col-6">
                            <h2>The Use-Case Diagram</h2>
                            <p>
                                The use case diagram displays all the functionalities, the people that will be able to access the application
                                and the relationship between the users and which of the functionalities they have access to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is important to get right from the design stage so that you don't run into any issues while
                                developing the application. Of course these ideas can still change during development but the diagram functions as
                                a solid starting point.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the concept discussions we came to the conclusion that the following roles will be involved in the application.

                    <p class="pt-0">
                        For the creation of this website we used <span>Laravel</span>, this includes the usage of Livewire and PHP.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Landing Page</h4>
                        <p>
                            I chose to create the landing page for our website, first creating a layout that everyone was happy with.
                            To help with the creation of this, I decided to make use of <span>Tailwind css</span> and <span>Flowbite</span>.
                            These speed up the process of making a layout considerably since I could start from premade components and alter
                            them like I wanted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the technical side, I requested the important display information from the database such as name, description, thumbnail,
                            status and various deadlines of the competition. All this information got neatly displayed on a compact card,
                            then it was onto the functionality.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Different users (students, teachers, admins) have a different view of the page. For example <span>only students</span>
                                are allowed to <span>participate</span> in competitions. So the registration functionality would only be visible
                                to students.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Students or verified members can propose competitions which the admins will first have to accept before
                                they are shown to the public.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                During the registration phase students will be able to register.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                While the competition is ongoing, participants will be able to submit a submission.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When the voting stage is active, all students on the platform can vote on a winner. But only if the competition
                                has a public vote!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Pagination to avoid a massive scrollbar.
