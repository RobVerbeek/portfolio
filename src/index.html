                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        The concept phase of an application intrigues me. Learning about the client's vision and working out how to realize it is very enjoyable to me.
                        Besides that I <span class="fw-bold">love visualisations</span>. From data to creating websites or designing applications. I believe being healthy brings happiness so <span class="fw-bold">fitness and cooking</span>
                        healthy are a passion of mine.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        But why IT?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This might be clich√©, but I went into IT because I grew up using a lot of technology. After high school I first
                        decided to work for a few years but after having built
                        my own pc I thought it would be interesting to pursue IT more.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Ambitions</h3>
                    <p>
                        I can't shake the idea of making my own fitness application. Since one of my favorite hobbies is working
                        out it would be amazing to develop my own app that lets me track progress and keep track of my routines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for future jobs, I'm keeping myself <span class="fw-bold">open-minded</span>. A consultant, data analyst that
                        creates visualizations or being involved in the concept/design phase for projects are all fields that
                        intrigue me.

                <h3>Feathers and Fuselages</h3>
                <p>
                    Wildlife strikes can be a serious issue, over the last 33 years there have been many incidents
                    because of wildlife strikes. I visualized the recorded data from these wildlife strikes
                    on airplanes in the US into several sheets of graphs. The goal of the project was to showcase the impact
                    they can have on not only the economy but also the passengers aboard the airplanes.
                    This project was part of the data visualization course during my studies.

                <h2>Utopia</h2>
                <p>
                    Utopia is a website created to help fresh graduates decide on what course they would like to pursue in
                    higher education. This was a <span class="fw-bold">group project</span> in which we chose to make a game where the player would have
                    to control the character and complete various objectives by writing code. <span class="fw-bold">My role</span> was to handle the
                    <span class="fw-bold">visuals</span>. I created the maps in which the player moved in by <span class="fw-bold">coding, rendering
                    and drawing</span> the maps with asset sets.
